# Ember D3 Components

This addon provides EmberJS components for visualizing data with d3.js.

See it in action: http://bryanhunt.github.io/#/d3

This project is very much in the experimental phase and the API is in flux.  
Use with caution.

Things that seem to be working:
* Scales
* Axis
* Grid
* Text
* Line
* Arc
* Area
* Bar
* Circle
* Pie Layout
* Stack Layout

If you need to create charts, I would recommend checking out: https://github.com/BryanHunt/ember-d3-charts

If you have questions, you can generally find me on Slack in the EmberJS Community.

This is a fairly significant undertaking and I would welcome additional contributors.
